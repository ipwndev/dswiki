DSwiki is an offline viewer for Wiki markup, for example for the
Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wiktionaries, ...

DSwiki is NOT a web browser!

## Why DSwiki? ##

DSwiki is optimal for all people with a Nintendo DS that like to
have their information "portable", but cannot access the Internet
directly. So far, no Program was very good in displaying the
Wikipedia on the DS. NewDictS can display an uncompressed dump, but
this dump is outdated, and the Wikipedia has grown dramatically
since then, so compression was absolutely necessary. In addition,
most homebrew programs can't handle UTF-8.

## Features ##

  * Get the complete(!) Wikipedia on a Nintendo DS. The English language edition fits on a 4GB storage device, the German edition is just 1.2GB.
  * Quite good handling of internal links. Alternative display text and appended letters are supported to create the same look as in the online version. Subpage links are supported.
  * Very good Unicode/UTF8-Support (as much - or as little - as the underlying font covers)
  * Fast and easy searchable index
  * Bookmarks

## Usage ##

Just take the tutorial at the first start, or start it any time later
from the menu.

## Installation ##

1. Copy DSwiki.nds somewhere on your flash card, DLDI-patch it if
> necessary.

2. Create dumps of your favorite wiki or download already prepared ones.
> Visit http://code.google.com/p/dswiki/wiki/Dumps for a list.

3. Copy all files with the extensions

> ifo
> idx
> ao1
> ao2
> db?    [? = one letter, typically "a" or "b", "z" is used in older versions ](.md)

> into /dswiki. This directory must exist in the root directory of your flash card.

## Planned Features ##

  * Improved Search (advanced input)
  * "Find as you type" inside an article
  * Switching between fonts on the fly
  * Customization
