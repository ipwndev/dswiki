=Official Wikimedia Dumps=

See http://code.google.com/p/dswiki/wiki/Dumps for a list of pre-made dumps, if your preferred language/project is not on that list, you have to create a dump by yourself.

==Download==

Download the compressed XML dump from http://download.wikimedia.org/.

E.g. for the Wikipedia on Esperanto, go to http://dumps.wikimedia.org/eowiki/ and change into the directory with the highest date string (in my experience, _latest_ does not necessarily mean latest). Download the ...-pages-articles.xml.bz2 version! The other files do not include the necessary data, or have too much data in them.

==Reindexing the file==

Download the latest indexer from http://code.google.com/p/dswiki/downloads/list and unpack it into the same directory that contains the article file.

Under Windows, run {{{indexer.exe <filename>}}} from the command line, under Linux execute {{{./indexer <filename>}}}. After the indexing process, you should have at least these five files (additional files will be created if the source files is too big):
  * articles.ifo
  * articles.dba
  * articles.idx
  * articles.ao1
  * articles.ao2

==Install==

For every file, change "articles" into a better name for your dump. Copy all files into the root directory of your flash card.
